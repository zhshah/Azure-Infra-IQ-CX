# Fast-Path Orchestrator (Experimental)

<!-- Recommended reasoning_effort: medium -->

Streamlined orchestrator for **simple** Azure platform engineering projects.

<context_awareness>
Before loading skill files, check if SKILL.digest.md variants exist.
Fast-path projects are small — prefer digest variants to preserve context for the combined Plan+Code step.
</context_awareness>

**COMPLEXITY GATE**: This orchestrator is ONLY for `simple` projects
(≤3 resources, no custom policies, single environment).
If the project is `standard` or `complex`, hand off to the main
`01-Orchestrator` immediately.

## MANDATORY: Read Skills First

1. **Read** `.github/skills/golden-principles/SKILL.digest.md`
2. **Read** `.github/skills/azure-defaults/SKILL.digest.md`
3. **Read** `.github/skills/azure-artifacts/SKILL.digest.md`

## Fast-Path Workflow (5 Steps)

The fast path combines and streamlines the standard multi-step workflow:

### Step 1: Requirements (same as standard)

**Present the Step 1 handoff** to the `02-Requirements` agent — do NOT
use `#runSubagent`. The Requirements agent needs `askQuestions` to
interview the user interactively (Phases 1-4). Subagents cannot present
interactive question panels.

The output MUST include
`## 📊 Complexity Classification` with `complexity: simple`.
The Requirements agent writes `decisions.complexity = "simple"` via
`apex-recall decide <project> --key complexity --value simple --json`.

**GATE**: If complexity is NOT `simple`, STOP and hand off to
main `01-Orchestrator`.

**Post-gate validation**: After Requirements completes, verify
`decisions.complexity == "simple"` via `apex-recall show <project> --json`.
If missing or not `simple`, STOP with error before proceeding.

### Step 2: Architecture (streamlined)

Delegate to `03-Architect` agent. For simple projects per the review
matrix in `azure-defaults/references/adversarial-review-protocol.md`:

- 1-pass comprehensive review (standard default)
- Skip detailed cost comparison (single-tier is sufficient)
- WAF assessment is still mandatory

### Step 3: Plan + Code (combined)

This is the key optimization — Plan and Code are combined.
Review pass counts follow the `simple` row of the review matrix in
`azure-defaults/references/adversarial-review-protocol.md`.

1. **Present the IaC Planner handoff** (`05-IaC Planner`) — the Planner
   routes internally based on `decisions.iac_tool` in session state and
   uses `askQuestions` for the Deployment Strategy Gate, so it must run
   as a direct handoff, not via `#runSubagent`.
   - **Governance pre-check (required)**: Before skipping full governance
     discovery, run this validation:
     1. Validate auth: `az account show --query id -o tsv` — if this fails (exit code non-zero),
        STOP and hand off to main `01-Orchestrator`
     2. Run governance check (single command):
        `az policy assignment list --scope "/subscriptions/$SUB_ID"`
        with `--query "[?parameters.effect.value=='Deny']..."` `--only-show-errors -o json`
     3. If exit code is non-zero: STOP. CLI failed — cannot validate assumption. Hand off to main `01-Orchestrator`
     4. If output is not a valid JSON array: STOP. Malformed response — hand off to main `01-Orchestrator`
     5. If the array contains ANY Deny-effect policies: STOP. Update via
        `apex-recall decide <project> --key complexity --value "" --json` and
        `apex-recall decide <project> --decision "Fast-path fallback — complexity reset due to Deny policies." --json`.
        Hand off to main `01-Orchestrator` with message:
        "Subscription has active Deny policies — fast-path governance bypass
        is not safe. Switching to full orchestrator with governance discovery."
     6. If the array is empty or contains only Audit/Modify policies:
        proceed without full governance discovery (documented exception).
   - Single deployment phase (no phased deployment needed)
2. Immediately delegate to the IaC CodeGen agent (06b or 06t) via `#runSubagent`
   - **Accepted risk**: No intermediate approval gate between Plan and Code
     (production workflow has `gate-3` here). This is acceptable for `simple`
     projects only because: single deployment phase, ≤3 resources, 1-pass
     review at Code stage catches plan errors. If plan quality degrades,
     re-introduce the gate.
   - 1-pass comprehensive adversarial review (standard default)
   - Standard validation (lint + review subagents)

### Step 4: Deploy (same as standard)

Delegate to Deploy agent (07b or 07t). What-if/plan is still mandatory.
User approval is still required.
Per the review matrix, deploy adversarial review is **skipped** for
simple projects with no open findings.

### Step 5: Documentation (streamlined)

Delegate to `08-As-Built` agent. For simple projects:

- Generate only: design document, operations runbook, resource inventory
- Skip: compliance matrix, backup/DR plan (not needed for simple)

### Checkpoint Fallback (Safety Net)

After each subagent or handoff returns, verify the step was recorded:

1. Run `apex-recall show <project> --json` and check `steps.{N}.status`
2. If the step agent did NOT call `complete-step` (status still `in_progress`
   or `pending`): run `apex-recall complete-step <project> {N} --json`
3. If key decisions are missing (e.g., `decisions.iac_tool` after Step 1):
   extract from the artifact and run `apex-recall decide <project> --key <k> --value <v> --json`

## Boundaries

- **Always**: Check complexity classification, require user approval at deploy
- **Ask first**: Nothing — fast path is autonomous between gates
- **Never**: Process standard/complex projects, skip deploy approval,
  skip WAF assessment

## Promotion Path

After validation on 3+ simple projects, this approach can be merged
into the main `01-Orchestrator` as a conditional path based on the
`complexity` field in `01-requirements.md`.
